# <U>Machine-Learning</U>
machine learning allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data.

# <B>Supervised Learning</B>

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression.

# <B>Regression</B>

Regression is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict continuous values.

### <B>linear Regression</B>
Linear regression is a linear model, e.g.1 a model that assumes a linear relationship between the rainfall(x) and amount of umbrella sold(y)

# <B>Classification</B>

The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data.

example. Here, we have data points belonging to three different fruits like blueberry, lime, and apple. We can classify them by using machine learning classification techniques. The three fruits are represented by three various related colors such as blue, orange, and yellow respectively. Then, we draw a linear line between them for clear separation and see how they are presented.
