# <U>Machine-Learning</U>
machine learning allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data.

# <B>Regression</B>

Regression is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict continuous values.

### <B>linear Regression</B>
Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the rainfall(x) and amount of umbrella sold(y)

# <B>Classification</B>

The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data.
